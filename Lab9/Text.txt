The classroom is designed to be a learning environment as you study and work toward achieving your degree
in Electrical and/or Computer Engineering. Therefore, you are expected to act in a professional manner and
to avoid carrying, using, or wearing anything that will be distraction or disruptive to the classroom.
You are also expected to dress professionally, speak civilly, avoid chewing or smoking of any kind (gum,
tobacco,cigarettes,etc.), avoid reading the newspaper or other magazines or books in class, and turn off
all cell phones/pagers. The Instructor may confiscate cell phones that ring within the classroom for the
duration of the class.
